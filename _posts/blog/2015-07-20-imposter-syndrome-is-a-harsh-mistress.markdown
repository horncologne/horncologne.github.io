["The self-hating Web Developer"](http://joequery.me/code/the-self-hating-web-developer/) is a post by [JoeQuery](http://joequery.me) that throws harsh light on something that I have seen in many of my friends and colleagues in technology. I suffer from it myself at times: [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

JoeQuery, despite being empirically a "good enough" developer to support his extended family doing web work in PHP, Python, Django, Drupal, and other technologies, has somehow bought into the notion that this isn't "real programming."

Well so what? It is good enough to create billions in economic value and pay your rent. It shouldn't matter how imperfect it is from some theoretical standpoint. It does the job. It's good enough. PHP [runs 80% of the web](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all).

JoeQuery! You and your work are good! Good enough! The web is changing our world; you're part of that. Go back to learning out of love, not fear (that part of your post was really insightful). You've got this.

If you want a refreshing change, you could try hitting some Drupal community channels or events, too. We're a positive, welcoming community. We've got Drupal 8 to show you, too :-D
