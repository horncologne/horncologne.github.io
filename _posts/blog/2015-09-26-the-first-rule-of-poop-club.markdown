I recently spent most of a week in the company of good Italian friends on a concert trip in the Czech Republic. I was playing a concert with two of them; the rest took the chance to come with us for a short holiday. Outside of Italy and therefore outside of the usual context, I noticed something. I call it "The First Rule of Poop Club."

Italian is a beautiful, rich language, perfectly suited to the warmth of its speakers and the glory that is their cuisine. I am glad I have learned it well enough to be accepted as an equal in most conversations with inhabitants or expats from the peninsula italica.

##All poop, all the time
Along with some particularly gorgeous expressions (like these), one notices the wild prevalence of the verb *cagagre*--"to shit"--in daily vernacular. Here are a couple of examples, taken from my personal experience and corroborated by this post by NAME HERE.

- **Cagarsi sotto**--"to shit oneself below"--means to be scared. *Mi sono cagato sotto*--"I was terrified."
- **Non mi cago**--"I don't shit myself"--means "I don't care." Yes, very similar to "I don't give a shit," in English.

##Except when you mean poop
The first rule of the poop club is never talk about poop. With all of the different meanings of "shit" in Italian, and hearing it any number of times in a normal, civil conversation among friends, I noticed I never heard it when referring to the act itself.

- **Devo mandare un fax**--"I have to send a fax"--means **I HAVE TO POOP**
- **Devo andare in ufficio**--"I have to go to the office"--means **I HAVE TO POOP**.
- **Volevo fare una telefonata, ma mi era caduta la linea**--"I wanted to make a phone call but I couldn't get through"--means **I NEED TO POOP, but I am constipated**.

The use of euphemism is so strong that when I said, "I need to go to the hotel to drop off my things after the concert, before we go out to dinner," my friend Angelo thought I meant **"I NEED TO POOP"**. His answer confused me for a moment, before I burst out laughing, which in turn confused him. Our conversation went like this:

- Me: "I need to go to the hotel to drop off my things after the concert, before we go out to dinner."
- Angelo: "Why, do you need to talk with the Pope?"*

##Talking with the Pope
* **"DO YOU NEED TO POOP?"**
