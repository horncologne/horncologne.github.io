_In which Martin Bryant shows me why I don't hum any Beatles tunes anymore._

The Beatles were still on the radio when I was a kid. We had two or three of their albums on our shelf. I really liked a lot of their songs. Now? Frankly, I never hear them. Why? Maybe it's because like so many people nowadays, I mostly listen to streamed music and they're not there.

The KLF isn't there either, but the apparently tortured geniuses behind the KLF removed their catalog from sale altogether in 1992; a move not unknown in the history of Western art and music. I am just glad I have a couple of their CDs that I picked up when they blew my mind just in time for me to still find them in stores.

My mental juggling act here:

- **Should artists have control of their output and œuvre?** Yes, mostly, probably, yes.
- **Should we strive to preserve humanity's cultural heritage and make it available now and for future generations?** Absolutely, yes.
- **Should copyright extend decades beyond an artist's death?** No, but that is a different conversation.
- **Should contemporary profit motivation trump our ability to preserve and archive our cultural heritage, for example with DRM and ill-conceived copyright legislation?** No, but we have yet to find a good balance between benefitting artists, corporate interests, and the non-monetary value of our cultural artifacts.
